# Multiple-Target-Image using Unity and Vuforia Engine

Project Summary

	Using the Unity software together with the Vuforia SDK, we created a multiple image target augmented reality project. It can run on a webcam in Unity though it must be downloaded in an APK file format for it to run in different platform such as smartphone. To actually use it, the APK file must be downloaded and installed on a smartphone with the compatible version – Android 4.1 JellyBean to currently available Android version.  As the user opened the application, it should detect the target image which is an anime girl. Once the image is recognized, user can be able to see augmented reality content which is another image of an anime girl and a ball. This feature of Augmented Reality is ideal for augmenting magazines, product packaging, books, user manuals, catalogs, coaster, gaming cards, and more.
